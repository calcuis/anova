# anova
an example of R code for conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA)

```
# load the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# load the data
data <- read_csv("data.csv")

# perform the ANOVA
aov_result <- aov(response ~ group, data = data)

# print the summary of the ANOVA
summary(aov_result)
```

This code first loads the `tidyverse` library, which includes a number of useful functions for data manipulation and analysis. Then, it loads the data from a CSV file using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package. Next, it performs the ANOVA using the `aov()` function, specifying the response variable and the group variable. Finally, it prints the summary of the ANOVA using the `summary()` function. The output will include the F-statistic and the p-value, which can be used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the group means.
